b 0 problems: Data representation and bitwise operations

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.
You may NOT use any calculators.  Make sure you are on your own computer,
editing your own file.

This is your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is 
expected that you will not finish during this lab time.  

For each problem, make sure you write your answer exactly on the line with 
the problem number (i.e. 1a) that follows the question.

Binary representation:

0.  Count how many instances there are of the word "hello" in this file.
You can use the vi command for searching for a word.  Then, after you count
them, you might want to remove them so that it is easier to read the problems.
0a) Including the "hello" in this question, there are 8 of them. 

1. In a decimal number, a 1 in position 3 is worth 10^3.  Write your
answer is exponent form just as I did in the decimal example.
In binary, how much is a 1 in position 3 worth?
1a) 2^3. 
In octal, how much is it worth?
1b) 8^3.
In hexadecimal, how much is it worth?
1c) 16^3.


2. Convert the following decimal numbers into 8-bit binary with the 
format 0b01001111:
2a) 13 = 0b00001101
2b) 9 = 0b00000101
2c) 19 = 0b00010011

3. Convert the following unsigned binary numbers into decimal:
3a) 0101 = 5
3b) 1101 = 13
3c) 1011 = 11

4.  Convert the following decimal numbers into 2-digit hexadecimal numbers.
Report the answers in the format 0xff.
4a) 73 = 0x49
4b) 23 = 0x17
4c) 151 = 0x97

5.  Tell the number of bits for each term.
5a) byte =   8 bits
5b) nibble =  4 bits

6.  Bit positions:
Remember that we number bit positions from right to left, starting with 0.
The rightmost bit of a 16-bit number is what position (express as a decimal)?
6a) 0
The leftmost bit of a 16-bit number is what position (express as a decimal)?
6b) 15

7.  Fill in the following properties of binary numbers.  
Remember to place the answer on the line with the problem number.  
Do not capitalize your words.  If you want to express
an exponent, use the '^'.  For example, the value 8 is 2 to the 3rd power.  
Express this as 2^3.

Shifting the digits one to the left is the same as performing a 
multiplication by
7a) 2
If the bit in bit position 0 is a 1 (for an integer), the number is
7b) odd
If a number contains all 0's except a 1 in position n, the value is
7c) 2^n
Shifting the digits two to the right is the same as performing a division by
7d) 4

8. Convert the following decimal numbers into 8-bit binary with the
format 0b01001111:
8a) -15 = 0b11110001
8b) -6 = 0b11111010
8c) -10 = 0b11110110
