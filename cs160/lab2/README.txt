issues:
1. I have no idea how to print the evaluation after checking all the expressions. For example, if my program starts checkng the second expression in the list, it foget the first result. 
exp1; exp2;  When it starts to check exp2, it forgets the result of exp1.

So, I used a result array to handle it. So, it might crash if it has more than 50 expressions.

2. The number in outOfBoundsError doesn't match so well. I think it should be fine?


Other stuff looks fine.
