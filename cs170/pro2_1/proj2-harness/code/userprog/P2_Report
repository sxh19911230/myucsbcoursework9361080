Report for Project 2

Group member: Xianghong Sun

I soloed this program. However there are some bugs caused me headache and I almost gave it up.
There are still bugs (for example, the kernelBuf stuff). So I just commented the delete [] kernelBuf and used printf instread of putchar.

The stdin is not implemented.

Not sure what else to say.
