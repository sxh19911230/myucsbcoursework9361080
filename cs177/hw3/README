It just happend the password start with 'a'

Subsitution
acc: j_snow

I did two version on subsitution.

subsitution.c:
The first one is too complex. It tries every possible subsitutions.
For example: password
p can be in lower case or upper case, which has 2 options.
a can be in lower case, upper case, or @, which has 3 options.
s can be in lower case, upper case, $, or 5, which has 4 options.
w can be in lower case, upper case, or uu, which has 3 options.
...

One word can be subsitute into 2 * 3 * 4 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 3456 forms.
Forms for longer word can be doubled or more.
Search through the original dictionary takes 5 min. And this subsitution might take two weeks.
So, I think professor might ease the cracking to be subsituting all same letter once.

subsitution2.c:
So, this is the second version. It subsitute same letter once to make it less complex.

Failed
acc: arystark

No idea how to crak



Other attempts (all failed):

Combination:
Attempt 1: Combine every two words in the dictionary: this took too much time so I gave up.
Attempt 2: Try the common words (Example: "the") + every words in the dictionary
Attempt 3: Add numbers after every words. Example: password1

Common password attack:
Attempt 1: Find a common password dictionary and name dictionary online, do the dictionary attack
Attempt 2: Subsitute the letters in the dictionaries above

Totation:
Attempt: Rotate letter by 1-26 places and try.

Some other stupid attempts that I do not remember.
